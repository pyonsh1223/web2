    English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England
  and eventually became a global lingua franca. It is named after the Angles,
  one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the area of Great Britain
  that later took their name, England.

  </p> <p style="margin-top:40px;">Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula on the Baltic Sea.
   English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon
    while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages,
     particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as Latin and French.
